# About Me
I'm a junior software developer and indie game dev currently working on my BS in Computer Science. I've been programming since I was knee high to a duck, making little calculators and scripts to generate outcomes from tables for TTRPGs, but I never really got serious with it until about 2024. That's when I decided I wanted a career change after 6 years and 2 contracts with the army.

## Game Development
I primarily work in Unreal Engine 5, though I dabble in Godot when I want something a little simpler and lighter. I've participated in a few game jams and published a couple games on Itch.io, but 
I'm actively working on a much larger project that I'll be happy to share once I've got a little more to show off. I'm also always looking to collaborate if anyone wants to team up for a project!

## Software Development
I'm taking classes towards my BS in Computer Science and I'll be uploading all the programs I write here to document my journey from ameteur programmer to a slightly-less ameteur programmer (or maybe even... dare I say... a professional programmer?)

Some of my projects include:
  - The Super-Fun-Number-Guessing-Extravaganza!
  - A python-powered pay calculator that takes your weekly hours worked and your pay rate and determines your weekly pay, taking into account and doing the necessary calculations for overtime
